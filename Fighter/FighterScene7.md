# VICTORY

After delivering a great punch, the gang leaves in defeat.

You bask in your victory but that victory didnt last long as you notice the mess made in the fight.

The owner of the pub lets it slide though as the waitress you saved was her daughter.

The waitress was so grateful for what you did she decide to help patch you up.
