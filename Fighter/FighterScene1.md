# Bar Brawling

A small gang of bad folk causes a huge ruckus at the pub

They're bullying the patrons and harassing the waitresses

You know a fight is about to go down

Its a gang of three 

1. A tall ugly guy a bit too much on the heavier size.
2. An average build Elf.
3. Short and skinny. Definetly agile

> The bulkest member grabs her arm and trys to smooch her. She pushes him off her and slaps him.

He gets angry. "Damn broad!" He gets ready to strike her until...

*DONK* a cup hits the back of the big guy's head.

"WHO DID THAT?!?!"

You whistle for the gang's attention.

"Hey Tubby. I doubt the ladies like a guy who looks worst than ogre's bum." You said.

The big guys gets mad livid and bum rushes you head on
