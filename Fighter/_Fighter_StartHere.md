# Fighter

Since the day you were born you were blessed with the blood of the devine.

Growing up in a guild of fighters, you learned special striking techniques and the fundementals of hand to hand combat.

Your guild would unfortunetly disband one day. Leaving you to roam the streets with nothing but your skills.

Doing what you know best, you do a couple side jobs that puts your fist to good use.

and after a long day of hard work you would relax at a local pub.
