You're a knight, in charge of protecting the beautiful princess of the castle.  You don steel armored helmet, breastplate, gauntlets and greaves :sunglasses:.  You have a sword that was bestowed upon you by your former knight when you were but a squire.  You are now the lead knight, in charge of protecting the castle :muscle:.

Suddenly, you hear a scream coming from the throne room :scream:.

Someone has snuck in the castle windows and absconded with the princess :anguished:.

You're heart drops :broken_heart:. "What do I do?" :confused:

:cat: [Jump out the window and give chase.]

:dash: [Head for the front gate of the castle to cut the thief off.]
