# GOOD ENDING

After erasing that wall from existence you see a lady reading a book under the peaking moonlight.

Looking away from her page for a moment she notices you from afar.

Giving you a smile and a friendly gesture.

She welcomes you to join her in her studies of the arcane art.

You left that tower having gained a new friend and how to turn a star into a meteor.
