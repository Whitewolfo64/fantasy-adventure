# EYECUE

Youre at the entrance of the Tower of EYECUE

A giant door stands in front of you made out off shiny metal aetherial esque metal.

Youre were thinking of blasting this hunk of junk with the potent power of a moonlight beam.

You WERE thinking of giving out some mystical back shots until you realized just how thicc the door was.

You examine your surrounding and spot a window thats quite a ways up.
